# MPM_QSM
QSM pipeline for Multi Parametric Mapping acquisitions


# Main computational steps:

 1) complex-fit over echoes for pdw and t1w images,
    simple phase difference for mtw images
    for odd and even echoes done separately
 2) ROMEO phase unwrapping
 3) masking based on ROMEO quality map
 4) rotation to scanner space for oblique acquisitions
 5) PDF background field removal
 6) star QSM for dipole inversion as default (optional: non-linear dipole inversion)


# Installation steps:

1. Download Zip with all the files from:

	https://github.com/baskadym/MPM_QSM.git
	or clone it to your GitHub repository

2. Download compiled version of ROMEO either for windows or linux:
	
	https://github.com/korbinian90/ROMEO/releases/tag/v3.2.0
	and unzip it in chosen destination

3. Download sepia toolbox:
	
	https://github.com/kschan0214/sepia.git
	and unzip it in chosen destination

4. Set you local paths to MEDI and STI toolboxes downloaded in step 1 in file:
 	/your_path/sepia-master/SpecifyToolboxesDirectory.m

	as following:
	MEDI_dir = '/your/MEDI/path/';
	STISuite_dir = '/your/STI/path/';
	FANSI_dir = [];
	SEGUE_dir = [];

5. Add to your matlab path: SEPIA toolbox and MPM_QSM folder
6. Edit MPM_QSM.m user parameters, where you specify folders to you nifti files

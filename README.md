# MPM_QSM
QSM pipeline for Multi Parametric Mapping acquisitions




Installation steps:

1. Download Zip with all the files from:

	https://github.com/baskadym/MPM_QSM.git
	or clone it to your GitHub repository

2. Download compiled version of ROMEO either for windows or linux:
	
	https://github.com/korbinian90/ROMEO/releases/tag/v3.1.4
	and unzip it in chosen destination

3. Download sepia toolbox:
	
	https://github.com/kschan0214/sepia.git
	and unzip it in chosen destination

4. Set you local paths to MEDI and STI toolboxes downloaded in step 1 in file:
 	/your_path/sepia-master/SpecifyToolboxesDirectory.m

	as following:
	MEDI_dir = '/your/MEDI/path/';
	STISuite_dir = '/your/STI/path/';
	FANSI_dir = [];
	SEGUE_dir = [];

5. Add to your matlab path: SEPIA toolbox and MPM_QSM folder
6. Edit MPM_QSM.m user parameters, where you sepcify folders to you nifti files
